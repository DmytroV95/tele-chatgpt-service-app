# TeleChatGPT Service App

## Project Overview

### Description
The TeleChatGPT Service App has been successfully implemented as a Java application leveraging the Spring Framework and Spring Security. This application seamlessly integrates a Telegram bot with Chat GPT, providing valuable services through the Telegram platform. Additionally, a robust web interface for administrators has been developed, enabling efficient management of interactions between the Telegram bot and clients.

### Technologies and Tools Used

- **Spring Boot:** The project is built using the Spring Boot framework, providing a robust and scalable backend.
- **Spring Security:** Authentication and authorization are managed using Spring Security to ensure secure access to endpoints.
- **Spring Data JPA:** Spring Data JPA simplifies database operations and enables easy interaction with the database.
- **Swagger:** Swagger is integrated to provide interactive API documentation and testing capabilities.
- **Mapstruct:** Mapstruct is used for object mapping between DTOs and entities.
- **PostgreSQL:** PostgreSQL is used as the database management system.
- **Liquibase:** Liquibase is employed for database version control and management.
- **Docker:** Docker is used for containerization of the application and database.

## Features

### 1. Telegram Bot Functionality
- Implemented a Telegram bot with advanced functionality that effectively communicates with Chat GPT.

### 2. Web Interface for Administrators
**Registration and Login:**
- Administrators can register and log in securely, ensuring exclusive access to administrative functions.

**Chat Log Management:**
- Developed an intuitive interface for administrators to view chat logs stored in a PostgreSQL database. This feature enhances transparency and facilitates efficient monitoring.

**Client Communication:**
- Integrated a feature allowing administrators to send responses to clients directly from the web interface. These responses are seamlessly delivered to clients via Telegram.

### 3. Security Measures
- Implemented Spring Security to ensure restricted access to the web interface and guarantee secure authentication for administrators.

### 4. Website Interface
- The web interface is designed as a RESTful application, providing a user-friendly experience. It can be accessed through a template engine or a client-side component in JavaScript. Testing the API interaction can be done effortlessly using tools such as Postman.
